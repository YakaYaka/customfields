Afterwards use the GLPI web\r\nUI to install and activate the plugin.\r\n\r\nMigrations of old version of the plugin are possible by just overwriting the\r\nprevious code with this version (better removing the files from the previous\r\nversion first) and using the update function in the web UI. (Please backup\r\nyour data prior to this!)\r\n\r\n[GLPI forge]: https://forge.indepnet.net/projects/customfields","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
